1. use images_to_np file to generate .npy file of the dataset. This train_images.npy file will be used to train our model.

2. Run LeNet.py once to train and save the model Lenet_all_60.h5 file.

3. After that no need to train again, so run LeNet.py after model.load(Lenet_all_60.h5); to make predictions.
